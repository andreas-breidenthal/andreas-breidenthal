# Andreas Breidenthal

I am a writer fascinated by the "quiet gaps" in history—the moments where records vanish, voices are edited, and silences determine the fate of nations. 

My work blends archival precision with narrative imagination, inviting readers to question what history preserves—and what it chooses to forget.

## 📚 Friction: A Trilogy of the Painfully Possible  
*Archival fictions exploring the architecture of silence (1888–1914).*

* **[Operation Seamless](https://github.com/andreas-breidenthal/friction-trilogy/_01-operation-seamless.md)**: A Victorian dossier on the systematic erasure of a murder in 1888.
* **[Victoria Unpublished](https://github.com/andreas-breidenthal/friction-trilogy/_02-victoria-unpublished.md)**: An enquiry into the editorial shaping of a Queen's private voice.
* **[The Scalpel Slipped](https://github.com/andreas-breidenthal/friction-trilogy/_03-the-scalpel-slipped.md)**: A narrative of the 1914 collapse and the diplomacy of withholding.

### Methodology & Influences
I treat the historical record like a codebase with missing commits. My approach is heavily influenced by the scholarly rigor of **David Crowther’s *The History of England*** and the sharp wit of ***1066 and All That***.

Everything in this repository is dedicated to the **Public Domain (CC0 1.0)**. 

> *"Recorded history is just that—recorded history. It may be the truth, but is it all the truth?"*
