# Andreas Breidenthal

I am a writer fascinated by the "quiet gaps" in history—the moments where records vanish, voices are edited, and silences determine the fate of nations. 

My work blends archival precision with narrative imagination, inviting readers to question what history preserves—and what it chooses to forget.

### Methodology & Influences
I treat the historical record like a codebase with missing commits. My love of history has been heavily influenced by the humorous, yet meticulously accurate **David Crowther’s *The History of England* podcast** (in his own words: *"I am horribly and gum-bleedingly non fictional"*) and the *rather-more-fictional* sharp wit of **Sellar & Yeatman's *1066 and All That***.

Everything in this repository is dedicated to the **Public Domain (CC0 1.0)**.
